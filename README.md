# 05-Space-shooter
This program runs a python arcade game that has a playable spaceship that fires at enemy aliens using the left click. Three shots will kill the enemy and with every hit, the player recieves points in the top left of the screen. I wanted to have gravity applied to the enemy side, so there was added chalange of the enemy coming closer, as well as more than one type of enemy, but was unable to program it successfully.
