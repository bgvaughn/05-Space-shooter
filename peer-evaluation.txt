Q):What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project? 
A):That Catlin is alot better at this than me and has a better hadle on this than I.

 

Q):What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
A):More detail to the smaller things like less movement and not getting crzy with the code maybe.
 

Q):What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
A):None really I mean he already said he was going to make longer and keep working on it so I think that covers it.
 

Q):What could have been clearer or better commented?
A):Maybe the File name for the ships themselves could have been made more clearly or change some of the file names.
 

Q):Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
A):The only part that is confusing is all of it still I really dont know what I'm looking at still and just change parts of the code I need to other than knowing one needs to define all things.
 

Q):Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
A):It does and the name and year have been changed.
 

Q):What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
A):Maybe a little more description of the code itself and its innerworkings but the game it self runs great.
 

Q):Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
A):It was Great and I mean it was a game with shooting enemies in space and beyond. Two thumbs up in my book!
